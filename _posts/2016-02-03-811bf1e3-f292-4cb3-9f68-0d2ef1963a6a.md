_Chenopodium berlandieri_. Lamb's quarters. Goosefoot. One of the most prolific native plants in North America, now best known as a nuisance weed and wayward cousin of the miracle health food quinoa (_Chenopodium quinoa_).

The long devalued species once was among the highest-valued crop plants on the continent, a legacy only told by the charred remains of seeds harvested hundreds of years ago. Those seeds, preserved through fire and the shelter of rock overhangs, reveal a crop as specialized and dependent on human cultivation as quinoa is today. Indeed, archaeological studies reveal that the domesticated chenopod of North America (_Chenopodium berlandieri _ssp_. jonesianum_) formed through a parallel process to that which morphed weedy South American chenopods into quinoa.

Quinoa has made quite the resurgence over the past decades. Recovering from centuries of repression following the Spanish conquest, it now enjoys enormous market growth and global research endeavours to adapt the crop to new climates as diverse as the planes of central North America and Europe to Middle Eastern deserts and even Space. Meanwhile, Chenopodium berlandieri remains laregely ignored by agriculture science.
